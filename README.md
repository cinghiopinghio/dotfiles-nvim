# [Neo]Vim configuration

Configuration of `vim` and `neovim`.
Vim configuration is kept only for backward compatibility (if I find a machine without `neovim`).

## Requirements

Neovim version `0.5` at least is required with LSP and TreeSitter support.
Vim 8.0.

## Install

The package is ready to be feeded to a symlink factory such as `stow` or [stowsh](https://github.com/mikepqr/stowsh).
For example one can use [makedot](https://github.com/cinghiopinghio/makedot).
